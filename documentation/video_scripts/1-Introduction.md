## How to Create Low-Level Authoritative Server Multiplayer Game in Godot in 30 minutes Part 1/5: Introduction 

Hey, I'm ET
This is an introduction video for this low-level, html5 compatible, networking in Godot series

This is an intermediate programming series, so we won't dive into deep detail on each and every step

Another caveat, I'm a solo developer, so perhaps some of my methods may not be considered "best practices"

That being said, we'll be working towards creating an authoritative server multiplayer game on an Asteroids-like game.

In this series, we will create a game executable that can either run as a server, a client, or both.

Also, we will create a docker container that runs the websocket server.

I will keep these videos fairly short and modular so you can refer back to a particular concept if necessary.

I love sharing my gaming experience with other players... especially when I am in a live multiplayer game. That's why I'm creating this series... so that you, watching this, will be inspired to make more experiences like the many I have enjoyed throughout my years!
